<h1>Pixel Sorting Program</h1>

Pixel sort is an interesting way to modify images. Based on the brightness of each pixel, the dots are sorted in each row of the image. Sorting is animated and the result is displayed on top of the initial image.
The program uses libraries to manage file IO (tkinter), pixel sort (numpy) and image display (pygame, pillow).

Current Features:
<li>Upload picture from your file directory</li>
<li>Experience real time sort</li>
<li>Adjust window dimensions</li>
<li>Use scrolling to view bigger images</li>

TODO:
<li>Enable downloading sorted images</li>
<li>Add vertical sort</li>
<li>Add adjustable brightness treshold</li>
